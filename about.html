  <h3 id="what-we-do">What we do</h3>
  <p>Our research is centered on understanding the dynamic interplay between ecology and evolution. We develop and apply innovative mathematical, computational, and statistical methods to explore how ecological interactions and evolutionary processes mutually shape each other. In our work, we emphasize that evolution is not a slow, separate process but is interwoven with the everyday dynamics of ecological communities. Our main research areas include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Eco-Evolutionary Networks</strong>: We study networks in which species interactions and evolutionary changes co-occur. By modeling how traits evolve in response to ecological pressures—and how, in turn, evolving traits alter network structure—we uncover feedbacks that drive community organization and biodiversity.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive Dynamics and Evolutionary Game Theory</strong>: We extend classical game-theoretical approaches by incorporating ecological context. Our models examine how competition, cooperation, and resource allocation drive the evolution of species traits, leading to adaptive shifts that impact community stability and resilience.</li>
    <li><strong>Coupled Population and Trait Dynamics</strong>: Integrating models of population dynamics with trait evolution, we investigate scenarios where ecological conditions and evolutionary adaptations reinforce or counteract one another. This approach helps us understand phenomena such as rapid evolutionary responses to environmental change and the emergence of novel community configurations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>General considerations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Our work is mainly theoretical/mathematical/statistical/computational. As such, any experimental/field work is carried out in collaboration with other laboratories.</li>
    <li>We typically make use of new, and sometimes innovative methods and tools. Thus, the main quality I am looking for is willingness to learn new, complex things.</li>
    <li>We do lots of programming. We mostly use R, python and C. I believe that having the whole lab “speak the same language” is key to fostering collaboration.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Graduate students</strong>: I accept students through the graduate program in Ecology &amp; Evolution. In case you’re applying, make sure to contact me well in advance, so that we have time to chat and get to know each other. </p>

  <p><strong>Research assistants</strong>: I typically keep two undergraduate students working in the lab. Come and see me if you think you’d be a good fit.</p>

  <p><strong>Diversity</strong>: the laboratory values diversity in all its forms (e.g., background, scientific approach, culture, etc.). Members of historically underrepresented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.</p>
