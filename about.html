<h1>About</h1>

  <h3 id="theoretical-biology-group">Theoretical Biology Group</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“too mathematical to interest most biologists and not sufficiently mathematical to interest most mathematicians”<br />
    J.B.S. Haldane</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The University of Chicago,<br />
  Department of Ecology &amp; Evolution,<br />
  Zoology Building room 403 and 403a,<br />
  1101 E. 57th street, 60637 Chicago, IL, USA.</p>

  <h3 id="what-we-do">What we do</h3>
  <p>We develop new mathematical, statistical and computational methods for theoretical ecology. The main areas we cover are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ecological networks</strong>: species in ecological communities form tangled networks of ecological interactions...</li>
    <li><strong>Stability of large ecological systems</strong>: using Random Matrix Theory...</li>
    <li><strong>Game theoretical models in ecology</strong>: many game-theoretical models...</li>
    <li><strong>Lotka-Volterra dynamics</strong>: the Lotka-Volterra equations were proposed more than a century ago...</li>
    <li><strong>Science of science</strong>: can we study the scientific endeavor using the same tools...</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="join-the-laboratory">Join the laboratory</h3>
  <p>Some general considerations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Our work is exquisitely theoretical/mathematical/statistical/computational...</li>
    <li>We typically make use of new, and sometimes innovative methods and tools...</li>
    <li>We do lots of programming. We mostly use R, python and C...</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Graduate students</strong>: I accept students through the graduate program in Ecology &amp; Evolution...</p>
  <p><strong>Postdocs</strong>: I rarely advertise positions...</p>
  <p><strong>Research assistants</strong>: I typically keep two undergraduate students working in the lab...</p>
  <p><strong>Diversity</strong>: the laboratory values diversity in all its forms...</p>
