  <p>The University of Chicago,<br />

  Zoology Building room 403 and 403a,<br />

  <h3 id="what-we-do">What we do</h3>
  <p>We develop new mathematical, statistical and computational methods for theoretical ecology. The main areas we cover are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ecological networks</strong>: species in ecological communities form tangled networks of ecological interactions. These networks differ from other social and technological networks in that the nodes are all different (i.e., they represent different species), rather than being of the same “type”.</li>
    <li><strong>Stability of large ecological systems</strong>: using Random Matrix Theory, we can study the large-scale behavior of ecological communities.</li>
    <li><strong>Game theoretical models in ecology</strong>: many game-theoretical models, like the replicator equation and its cousins, can be used to solve ecological questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Lotka-Volterra dynamics</strong>: the Lotka-Volterra equations were proposed more than a century ago, and yet they still hold some secrets. Many other ecological models can be recast as larger-dimensional LV models in which dynamics occur in a lower-dimensional manifold.</li>
    <li><strong>Science of science</strong>: can we study the scientific endeavor using the same tools we develop for other complex systems? How shall we evaluate the impact of researchers? How shall we fix the peer-review algorithm?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="join-the-laboratory">Join the laboratory</h3>
  <p>Some general considerations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Our work is exquisitely theoretical/mathematical/statistical/computational. As such, any experimental/field work is carried out in collaboration with other laboratories. I do not supervise experimental work.</li>
    <li>We typically make use of new, and sometimes innovative methods and tools. Thus, the main quality I am looking for is willingness to learn new, complex things.</li>
    <li>We do lots of programming. We mostly use R, python and C. I believe that having the whole lab “speak the same language” is key to fostering collaboration.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Graduate students</strong>: I accept students through the graduate program in Ecology &amp; Evolution. In case you’re applying, make sure to contact me well in advance, so that we have time to chat and get to know each other. Most years, I do not accept students, as I want to keep the laboratory at a manageable size.</p>

  <p><strong>Postdocs</strong>: I rarely advertise positions. Rather, I tend to target people I already know and like. Inquiries are welcome, but the best way to land a job in the lab is to meet me at conferences and workshops, or to come and visit me in Chicago.</p>

  <p><strong>Research assistants</strong>: I typically keep two undergraduate students working in the lab. Come and see me if you think you’d be a good fit.</p>

  <p><strong>Diversity</strong>: the laboratory values diversity in all its forms (e.g., background, scientific approach, culture, etc.). Members of historically underrepresented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.</p>
